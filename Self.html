<div id = "Mission"> 
<p>     Welcome to my website! I am a 20 year old college student studying Information Systems who grew up in the outscurts of Athens, GA, but would soon move to the Greater Cincinnati area.
    I enjoy just about every activity outdoors, flag football, dirtbiking, fishing, you name it! In addition to having my own share of fun, I am thrilled to launch my career as a young professional 
    as I continue to expand my network of those around me, and extend my technical expertise!
